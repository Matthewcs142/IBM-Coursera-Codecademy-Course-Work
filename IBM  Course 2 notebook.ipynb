Due to my undergraduate studies in a variety of social sciences and my personal studies in corpus linguistics, data driven language learning, business, and education I am aware of how powerful data science can be. As an example, data science methods could be applied to the language classroom to track and analyze a large number of variables measuring not only vocabulary growth but also environmental influences on vocabulary growth, which could not only improve the efficiency of language education but also provide regularly updating information that tracks student progress towards institutional goals and demonstrate curriculum effectiveness. When combined with corpus linguistics, this could be a very powerful approach for schools, especially private schools which are subject to and concerned with a lot of the same forces and questions that any other firm is subject to and concerned with. Another reason for my interest in data science is that it is difficult to make ends meet as a foreign language instructor in countries where the primary language happens to be the language you are an instructor for.</p>"
